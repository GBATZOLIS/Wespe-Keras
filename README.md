# Wespe-Keras

This repository contains the re-implementation of WESPE paper in Keras. 

Image enhancement is achieved by mapping images from the domain of phone images to the domain of DSLR images (denoted as domain A and B respectively in the code).

## Getting Started


Steps to run the training:

* Put the training and test data of domains A and B under the folders data/trainA, data/trainB, data/testA and data/testB
* run the model.py file (you can change the patch size, epochs, batch_size and other parameters in the main)

##Preliminary experiments/results

Visual results after 1 and 2 epochs (about 1.5h of training time in GTX 2080-ti) are saved in the folder "sample images"
