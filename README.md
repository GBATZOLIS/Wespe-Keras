# Wespe-Keras

This repository contains the re-implementation of WESPE paper in Keras. 

Image enhancement is achieved by mapping images from the domain of phone images to the domain of DSLR images (denoted as domain A and B respectively in the code).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


Steps to run the training:

1.) Put the training and test data of domains A and B under the folders data/trainA, data/trainB, data/testA and data/testB
2.) run the model.py file (you can change the patch size, epochs, batch_size and other parameters in the main)
